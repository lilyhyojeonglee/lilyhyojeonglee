# Hi, I’m Lily 👋

Computer Science graduate with experience building web and mobile platforms using **React, React Native, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS**. I have a strong foundation in **frontend architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), performance optimization, and deployment**, with hands-on experience owning features end-to-end in startup environments.

## What I focus on
- Frontend architecture and scalable component systems  
- Performance optimization (SSR, client-side rendering tradeoffs, state management)  
- Building responsive, pixel-accurate user interfaces  
- Collaborating closely with designers, product, and engineers  
- Owning features from design to production and iteration
